## Description

User plays an interactive fiction game via web interface. Game content (text, images) and storyline mostly generating real-time by openAI generative newral networks accessed by api. Game screen, like in most interactive fiction games has a big text block in center where user (player) writes his answers relying on current situation, earns items to inventory, gets various effects and different bars. Also there is image describing current location or situation. On sides there are inventory, current bars, location info.

User interface is pretty easy, player can reset game, play it by texting in the textbox, settings are also available.

Project saves all visited locations and meeted persons to file, so it can accessed much later. Also current game state is always saved to file, which means user can close game anytime and proceed later.
